<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_first.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->

<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->


<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.

# Include some data examples in your package

<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below

# Build the configuration file for time location

# lts_setup

    

  

```{r example-lts_setup}
lts_setup()
```

  

  




# Sample data collection shift - aka an assignement for one person at one time for one location

# lts_sample_shift

    

  

```{r example-lts_sample_shift}
## day1_universe.xlsx
config_path <- system.file("day1_universe.xlsx", package = "LocationTimeSampling")


lts_sample_shift(config_path,
                 sample_size = 400,
                 start_date = "11-01-23", 
                 end_date = "11-30-23",

# An enumerator allocation function

Assigning to enumerator each of the shift selected within the sample based on their availability



# Extrapolate the data collection results to obtain total population estimation

# lts_extrapolate_numbers

    

  

```{r example-lts_extrapolate_numbers}
lts_extrapolate_numbers()
```

  

  
 
 
<!--

# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
-->


# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
